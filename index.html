            <strong class="lead-in">The Mind in the Box.</strong> Paul A.M. Dirac was a Nobel Laureate ranked alongside Einstein and Bohr as one of the greatest theoretical physicists of the 20th century. Best known for predicting the existence of antimatter and laying the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics, his scientific work was renowned for its incredible precision.

            Yet, his personal filing system was famously chaotic. Throughout his life, Dirac stored thousands of his handwritten calculations, complex equations, photographs, and correspondence haphazardly in simple cardboard shoeboxes in his office.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a legendary career at Cambridge, Dirac spent his final fourteen years teaching here at Florida State University. The FSU Libraries are now proud stewards of his papers. This interactive exhibit digitizes the famous "Shoebox Collection," offering an intimate glimpse into the unfiltered thought process of a scientific genius.
